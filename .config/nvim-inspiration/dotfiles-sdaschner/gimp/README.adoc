== GIMP scripts

- Add under `/usr/share/gimp/2.0/scripts/` with the same permissions as the other scripts
- Start GIMP and run "`Filters`" -> "`Script-Fu`" -> "`Refresh Scripts`"
- The scripts should be available under the menus (e.g. "`Colors`" -> "`Cycle FG`") and can be assigned to keyboard shortcuts
